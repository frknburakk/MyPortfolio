  <h2>Kratos's Axe which i inspired by God of War</h2>
  <p>I first modeled it as a high-poly asset in Blender, then baked it into a low-poly version. I created the textures myself using Procreate and Adobe Photoshop. The neon blue engravings on the axe were also designed in Photoshop.</p>

  <h2>The Low Poly axe</h2>
  <p>I designed this axe using Blender and added creative details of my own. It's a low-poly model, and I created the textures partly in Photoshop and partly by applying materials directly in Blender.</p>

  <h2>traffic cone</h2>
  <p>This model was created in Blender and textured in Adobe Substance, which helped achieve a realistic and detailed appearance.</p>

      <p>All assets in this laboratory model were created by me in a low-poly style. The scene was featured in XIR, a game I was involved in during its development. (Click on the image to examine the model in detail.)</p>

      <h3>Desk and Chair</h3>
      <p>All the elements in this desk and chair scene were fully designed and modeled by me in a low-poly style. The scene is part of a custom low-poly house I created, and it was featured in XIR, a game I took part in developing. (Click on the image to examine the model in detail.)</p>

      <h3>Tiny Models on the desk</h3>
      <p>The books, coins, and pencil in this scene were all designed by me in a low-poly style. While I used pre-made textures for the book covers, the rest of the designs are entirely my own. (Click on the image to examine the model in detail.) </p>
